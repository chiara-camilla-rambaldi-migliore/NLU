In conclusion, the overall results are good. Despite the simplicity of the models and the regularization techniques used, the aim of the project has been achieved. Moreover, the evaluations done on three different models, allowed me to better understand how much the models differ and how the \emph{clipping gradient} technique improves the results. However, it could be interesting, as a further improvement, to develop a new way to load data, as mentioned in the sub section \ref{errors}. And to implement more difficult regularization techniques described in the \emph{Merity et al.} paper \cite{merity2017regularizing}.
